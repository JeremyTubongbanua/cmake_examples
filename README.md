# CMake Examples

My attempt to learn and provide examples of Modern CMake

## What is CMake?

CMake, in short, is a tool that helps you build your project. It "makes" your "makefile."

A makefile is a file that contains instructions on how to build your project. It is used by the `make` command to build your project.

An example of a makefile:

```makefile

```
